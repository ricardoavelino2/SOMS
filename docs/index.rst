Python package for Structural Analysis and Design

SOMS is a package developed by SOMS Structural team to automate, improve and facilitate analysis and design of structural systems within a Python-based multiplatform environment. 

SOMS library is based on open-source distributions and offers numpy-like functions to perform common design procedures and checks (eg AISC, NDS, etc).

SOMS functions can be imported into any python script, whether it is standalone python, a Jupyter notebook, or even inside grasshopper (Rhino 8). 

Among its intial functionalities, SOMS is able to import and export data with standard Strutural Engineering suite, such as CSi ETABS, SAP and SAFE.

Future developments will facilitate its use through Grasshopper components, Rhino commands and Jupyter notebook template sheets, as well as further interaction with native and commonly used grasshopper components and libraries.

To get started, follow the :ref:`Installation <installation>` and the :ref:`Tutorial <tutorial>` guides. Examples are available in the :ref:`Examples <examples>` page.

The docummentation of current functions and classes is available in the :ref:`API <api>`.

SOMS is supported by and developed by SOM.
